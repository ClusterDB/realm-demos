# Welcome to the Realm Inventory Demo.   

## Overview:
This demo has three distinct parts that interact to show end to end functionality of Realm and Atlas with other systems.  

- The first part (sync) consits of a mobile demo with syncronized access to Atlas data.  
- The second part (backOffice) takes advantage of Atlas integration with serverless functions and triggers that interact with REST, Kafka and Twilio.   
- The third part (html) is a Realm hosted application written with dymanic HTML and the browser SDK to act as an admin console showing inventory items across all stores.
